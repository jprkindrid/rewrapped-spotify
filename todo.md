## âœ… TODO: Spotify Wrapped-Style Web App (Capstone)

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Build a web app that lets users upload their Spotify data export (ZIP), parses and analyzes their listening history, and shows an interactive "Wrapped"-style dashboard.

---

### ðŸ§± Phase 1: Setup (2h)
- [ ] Create frontend + backend project structure
- [ ] Set up basic web page with file upload UI
- [ ] Set up backend API (FastAPI or Go)
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend

---

### ðŸ“‚ Phase 2: File Handling (4â€“5h)
- [ ] Accept `.zip` file upload from frontend
- [ ] Unzip contents on server (use temp directory)
- [ ] Locate relevant files (e.g. `StreamingHistory*.json`, `endsong*.json`)
- [ ] Send to JSON parser

---

### ðŸ“„ Phase 3: JSON Parsing & Struct Conversion (6â€“8h)
- [ ] Load and combine large `.json` files into one list
- [ ] Map to Go structs (already prepared)
- [ ] Normalize timestamp, duration, artist, etc.
- [ ] Filter bad/incomplete entries
- [ ] Save parsed data to memory or temp file (optional: DB)

---

### ðŸ“Š Phase 4: Data Analysis (6â€“8h)
- [ ] Calculate:
  - [ ] Top artists
  - [ ] Top tracks
  - [ ] Total minutes listened
  - [ ] Most active time of day / day of week
- [ ] Optional: generate audio feature-based summaries (if available)
- [ ] Generate yearly/monthly summaries
- [ ] Return results as JSON for frontend

---

### ðŸ’» Phase 5: Frontend Visualization (8â€“10h)
- [ ] Build dashboard UI in React (or Svelte/Vue)
- [ ] Display:
  - [ ] Top artists (bar chart or cards)
  - [ ] Listening patterns over time (line/heatmap)
  - [ ] Total minutes / most active periods (donut/pie)
  - [ ] Searchable table of tracks (filter by artist/date)
- [ ] Add animation or scroll transitions ("Wrapped" style)
- [ ] Allow reset / upload another ZIP

---

### ðŸ§ª Phase 6: Polish & Extras (4â€“6h)
- [ ] Add error handling for bad ZIPs / no data
- [ ] Improve mobile layout/responsiveness
- [ ] Optional: export data as image or PDF
- [ ] Optional: add login/auth for saving sessions
- [ ] Deploy to Fly.io / Vercel / Render

---

### ðŸ§  Stretch Ideas
- [ ] Cluster listening habits by mood/genre using ML
- [ ] Add genre detection (based on Spotify metadata if available)
- [ ] Compare multiple users (upload two sets of data)
- [ ] Match songs to Spotify audio features (via API)
- [ ] Build a shareable "MyWrapped" page (with public link)
